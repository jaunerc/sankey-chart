# Sankey chart create with D3.js + Vite.js
This repo contains a simple sankey chart implementation written in TypeScript.
I used the D3.js library to produce the chart and Vite.js for the bundling and running on localhost.

## Run the project
You have to run two commands.
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
